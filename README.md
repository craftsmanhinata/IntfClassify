# News
(June 27) using FFT could reach accuracy 94%.  

# Roadmap
* get dataset from USRP


# Config
Matlab Machine Learning Toolbox  & GPU 


# Generate interfer type  
* awgn  
* awgn+tone  
* awgn+chirp  
* awgn+filtN(filtered noise, low-passed white noise) 
* copyCat Noise, with unknown modulation and pulse shaping scheme.   

# How to run
execute `main.m` file.
